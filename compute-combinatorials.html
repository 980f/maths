    Computing Combinatorials with a finite range integer<br>
    <br>
    When computing C<sup>n</sup><sub>r </sub>,&nbsp; the number of
    combinations of n things taken r at a time, the naive formula of
    n!/r!(n-r)! involves terms which might exceed the range of the
    computer doing the calculation while the Cnr value itself might
    still be in range.<br>
    <br>
    The numerator is the produce of integer from n to n-r+1, the
    denominator the product of integers 1 to r. <br>
    If we divide each accumulating product by common integer factors
    then the eventual division will also be an integer and the
    intermediates will stay smaller, presumably enough to not overflow
    the native number range of the computer.<br>
    <br>
    We can ignore r=0 and 1 as those are special cases easily dealt with
    without division.<br>
    <br>
    Every other factor of the denominator is even, and as such has a
    non-zero power of 2 factor. If r=2 we have one 2 in the denominator
    product, if r=3 we still have just the one 2. <br>

    so the number of factors of 2 in a factorial is the sum of the
    number divided by the successive powers of 2, until you get to a
    power of 2 greater than the number.<br>
    <br>
    So, while forming the two products we reduce each term by removing
    their trailing zero bits while adding up how many of those zeroes we
    dropped.<br>
    Before forming the final ratio we need to apply the imbalance in
    number of twos removed to the appropriate term, else the integer
    division will not be exact.<br>
    <br>
    <hr width="100%" size="2">That as an easy extension of range.<br>
    <br>
    If range is more important than speed we can similarly divide each
    3rd term of each accumulating product by 3, carefully phasing our
    selection so that we only divide multiples of 3 by 3.<br>
    That can be done via initializing a counter with term % 3 and
    tracking when it hits zero, setting it back to 2 to count down
    again. And so on for each of the prime numbers less than the 'r'
    value. That is a lot of integer dividing, so the extended range
    better be worth it.<br>
    <br>

    <h3>P<sup>n</sup><sub>r</sub></h3>
    When computing permutations the best we can do is defer conversion
    to floating point by counting the powers of two as we go along
    multiplying all the odd values created from the integers. We can
    then pack them into a floating point format via counting leading
    zeroes (convert int to float) then adjusting the exponent with all
    of the powers of two we left out of the accumulating product.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr width="100%" size="2">
    <h3>Far more tedious but optimal:</h3>
    <br>
    For the numbers in the range of n to (n-r+1) their product will
    contain all of the prime factors of those in 1..r. Finding numbers
    with common factors and dividing them by those before forming the
    product reduces the range needed for intermediate calculations,
    without losing precision.<br>
    We can trial divide each of the numerator range members by r, and if
    the division is even drop both of them from the lists of numbers to
    muck with and accumulate the quotient into the product.<br>
    We can apply the sieve of Aristophanes reasoning to this task. <br>
    For as many primes as we are willing to allocate two run-time arrays
    we initialize each list by r or n modulo p<sub>i</sub>.<br>
    And I am going to stop right here as the amount of ram and code
    space needed for this is clearly more than just implementing a
    multi-word integer that is big enough for the task. <br>
    So, we shall compute the size required with only the removal of
    two's (a cheap task and easy to code dynamically):<br>
    <br>
    The maximum value of a series of Cn,r over the range r=1..n is where
    r = n/2 for n odd, n/2+1 for n even. The quick way to see that is to
    inspect the first rows of Pascal's triangle:<br>
    2: 1 2 1<br>
    3:1 3 3 1<br>
    4:1 4 6 4 1<br>
    Cn,n/2 = n!/((n/2)!)<sup>2<br>
    </sup>log<sub>2</sub>(n!) = sum i=2..n{ log<sub>2</sub>(i)}
    &lt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 +
    4 + 5 ... &lt;= sum 2 for 2, 3 for 4, 4 for 8, 5 for 16 ...<br>
    log2((n/2)!) = same formula for above but with half the n.<br>
    The first minus the second is the number of bits needed in the
    numerator, the second by itself is the number of bits needed in the
    denominator. <br>
    <br>
    To compute this sum we start with half the number of bits in n, 16
    for a 32 bit number. <br>
    Count the leading zeroes, word size - that is the number of bits
    needed to represent n. Shift by the power of 2 that is less than
    that, for 17 we shift 16, for 10 we shift 8. The number remaining is
    multiplied by that power of 2 and then we add numbers we can
    tabulate for the power of two used: <br>
    2x2 + 3x4 + 4x8 + 5x16 = sum (i+1)*2<sup>i</sup><br>
