        Savitsky-Golay refers to two scientists who published a paper on fitting data to polynomials as a digital filter<br>
        My interest was in finding peaks in XRF spectra, for calibrating the energy to channel gain of our detection system. <br>
        My first implementation target was an 80.effing.51 microcontroller and I had to write it as a language extension to a BASIC interpreter. I was able to determine that the maximum range of the values involved was with 24 bits, which did mean that I had to write 24 bit math routines for this 8 bit suitable-for-controlling-washing-machines processor. <br>
        Not in these papers (yet) is the interpolating of a fractional coordinate value for the zero crossing, which was critical to machine precision when the peak find was done on every sample, not just on well managed calibration standards.<br>
