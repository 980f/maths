    <h2>Field portable pass/fail analyzer</h2>
    <p>The utility of this analyzer is to confirm that a tank has the expected
      product in it. It does not provide a chemical answer. It recognizes the
      presence of impurities of a similar product, and some random impurities
      (they must have unexpected absorbance bands).</p>
    <p>"Operator Interface" refers to the user interface that is restricted to
      performing measurements and annotating results.</p>
    <p>A stable solid reference sample is part of the kit, to allow verification
      of the analyzer itself. <br>
      <br>
      The analyzer supports a barcode reader for some user data entry.</p>
    <h3>Operator Interface</h3>
    <p>The operator interface allows the operator to:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>identify sample/task</li>
      <ul>
        <li>scan or enter work order number and item</li>
        <li>scan or enter tank identifier</li>
      </ul>
      <li>invoke measurement.</li>
      <li>troubleshoot cellular and wifi connections</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Calibration data and analytical configurations are remotely maintained, i.e.
    not through the primary user interface. <br>
    Bluetooth/WiFi/USB is used for acquisition and maintenance of calibration
    and other configuration data.<br>
    <h3>Analytical Features</h3>
    For each measurement invocation an illumination is selected and a spectrum
    acquired. The spectrum is compared to reference spectra stored in the
    instrument. The operator is presented with an OK/BAD indication and perhaps
    a degree of confidence. <br>
    The spectra used for the match and the threshold for matching are part of
    the analytical configuration.<br>
    The matching process includes options for normalization, must-be-present
    lines (non-zero minimum intensity), and must-not-be-present lines (maximum
    set to essentially zero). Additionally a scan is made for lines that are not
    present in the reference spectra and BAD is signaled according to some as
    yet undefined rules.<br>
    <h3> Work Order</h3>
    The <span style="font-family: monospace;">Work Order</span> feature
    supports remote entry of product+tank information. The operator selects a
    work order and an item within it which results in an analytical
    configuration being selected and a prompt to the user of which tank to
    sample. If a peripheral for scanning tank identifiers is present then the
    analyzer will prompt for the tank to be scanned and will confirm that it is
    the one in the work order. The analyzer can be configured for one item per
    work order which simply removes item related prompting and reporting.
    Conversely one could scan a tank and a filler hose and the instrument would
    query whether there is a work order item compatible with them and have the
    operator confirm the item selected. <span></span><br>
    <h3><span>Tamper-resistant data collection</span></h3>
    <h3> </h3>
    <p>Measurements are recorded internally, encrypted before being handed over
      to any third party file management (i.e. the data is encrypted before
      being handed to a potentially encrypted file system or database system.
      The goal of this encryption is to make it uneconomical to falsify data,
      but is not strong enough to preserve trade secrets. Logged measurements
      can only be erased/deleted via the calibration user interface.</p>
    Each device is shipped with multiple public keys. There is one key each for
    measurement encryption, calibration and configuration encryption,
    communications proof-of-identity (ssl certificate). The private keys are
    delivered on separate media, which includes the installer for the remote
    maintenance program (such as via a USB drive, with backup at the official
    service department).<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Remote Maintenance</h3>
    Calibration and configuration is maintained via a bluetooth, wifi, or USB
    connection. The instrument appears as both a file server and a COM port. <br>
    The COM port is used for operating the instrument remotely, such as for
    taking reference spectra. The file server interface is used for reference
    spectra, analytical configurations, work orders, localization, and other
    such bulk data. This allows the owner to archive combinations as they see
    fit, and to use standard disk backup utilities to backup the instrument.<br>
    Field measurements are stored in an internal database. When space is
    exhausted older records are deleted. The remote maintenance interface can
    erase database contents via quantity, time, or date. <br>

    <h3>Collation of bar code reader support:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>enter tank id</li>
      <li>enter supply id</li>
      <li>enter operator id</li>
    </ol>
    <p>User interface localization:<br>
      The majority of the text of the user interface is in configuration files.
      There is a service option to temporarily override using the file, so that
      service personnel can use the language of the factory when servicing the
      instrument.</p>

    <h3>Use case:</h3>
    Railway tank filling<br>
    The railway car and the tank it is being filled from need to be matched. A
    sample is drawn from the car (which presumably is nearly empty) and a
    spectrum acquired which is compared with a stored spectrum. The operator is
    given a GO/NO-GO indication, and the analytical result (intensity at key
    lines data) is sent to the data collection. The associated spectrum is
    retained in the instrument until ?<br>
    <br>
    <h3> Internal details:</h3>
    There is a microcontroller in charge of all of the hardware components. It
    controls illumination and collection of the spectra. It also contains the
    encryption keys, so that the interface computer can be field replaced and
    then remotely configured. If practical the configuration etc. storage will
    also be on the microcontroller, but not the field data.<br>
    The user interface is also the communications controller. It is a low-end
    cell phone, with automatic launching of the analyzer interface program. It
    communicates to the microcontroller via bluetooth.<br>
    <br>
    Spectrum compression<br>
    Spectra are stored and communicated in both raw and in a lossy format. The
    lossy format is SVG, in many cases the customer will have tools that allow
    viewing of such spectra. The raw format is normally only used internal to
    the instrument. It is available remotely for evaluation of the instrument
    itself.<br>
