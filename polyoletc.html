    <p>Field portable pass/fail analyzer</p>
    <p>The utility of this analyzer is to confirm that a tank has the expected
      product in it. It does not need to provide a chemical answer. It must be
      able to recognize the presence of impurities of a similar product.</p>
    <p>"Operator Interface" refers to the user interface that is restricted to
      performing measurements and annotating results.</p>
    <p>A stable solid reference sample is part of the kit, to allow verification
      of the analyzer itself. </p>
    <p>Calibration data and analyztical configurations are remotely maintained,
      i.e. not through the primary user interface. <br>
      Bluetooth/wifi/USB is used for acquisition and maintenance of calibration
      and other configuration data.</p>
    <p>Measurements are recorded internally, encrypted before being handed over
      to any third party file management (i.e. the data is encrypted before
      being handed to a potentially encrypted file system or database system.
      The goal of this encryption is to make it uneconomical to falsify data,
      not enough to preserve trade secrets. Logged measurements can only be
      erased/deleted via the calibration user interface.</p>
    <p>Each device is shipped with multiple public keys. There is one each for
      measurement encryption, calibration and configuration encryption,
      communications proof-of-identity (ssl certificate). The private keys are
      delivered on separate media, which includes the installer for the remote
      maintenance program (cheap USB drive, with backup at the official service
      department).<br>
