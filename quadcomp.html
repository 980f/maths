    <h2>Derivation of integral preserving quadratic compression</h2>
    <p>In ED-XRF spectra the detectors have an uncertainty in energy
      estimation that goes like the square root of the actual energy.
      When eyeballing a spectrum plot a high energy peak of similar flux
      to a low energy one appears to have a lower flux. If we squeeze
      the horizontal scale of the graph we can make equal amplitude
      peaks have visually equal widths and heights.<br>

    <h3>Warmup</h3>
    First I describe how smooth linear compression works since the
    quadratic version is a simple extension. <br>
    We are merging a larger number of input points to create a smaller
    number of output points. <br>
    Viewed graphically we are integrating over a spread of X coordinates
    to generate a Y datum. <br>
    <br>
    Each input datum represents a fractional Y datum, I call this
    fraction XSTEP. <br>
    The heart of the algorithm is to add the next X datum to the
    accumulating Y datum, <br>
    add XSTEP to YFRAC where YFRAC is how much of the range of the Y
    datum has been accumulated. <br>
    <br>
    If XSTEP is 1/an_integer then that number of whole X data go into a
    Y datum. As this is often not the case we encounter X datums that
    need to be split between two Y datums. (I use the word 'datums' to
    refer to a small subset of a block of data). <br>
    To know how much of the X to go into each Y we inspect the YFRAC
    after each increment by XSTEP. <br>
    <br>
    If YFRAC is &gt;1 then we have crossed into the new Y datum, and the
    fractional part of YFRAC tells us how much of the X datum belongs to
    the NEW point. This is also the amount that was added erroneously to
    the Y datum-in-process so we <br>
    calculate the fraction of X, <br>
    subtract it from present accumulation, <br>
    output accumulator, <br>
    load accumulator with fraction-of-X. <br>

    (0.1/0.3)*X6 + X7 + X8 + X9 -&gt; Y2.<br>
    <br>
    To reduce error due to round-off we compute the numbers such as
    (0.2/0.3)*X3, then we subtract that rounded off value from X3 to
    yield the nominal (1.0-0.2/0.3)*X3 value rather than doing another
    multiply. The roundoff then becomes a slight jitter on the
    compression ratio, but integrals across the range of Y will get the
    same sum as an integral over the matching range of X.<br>
    <br>
    To know when to do this we have watched YFRAC become greater than 1.
    When it does so we thereafter only care about the fractional part of
    it so we can subtract 1 each time it happens. That integer overflow
    also happens to accumulate into the array index if the Y values are
    being put into an array rather than streamed.<br>
    <br>
    This happens to be isomorphic to a line draw algorithm in computer
    graphics, where each splitting of cell is a step in the y direction,
    and the 'fract' part is useful for anti-aliasing.<br>
    <br>
    <hr width="100%" size="2"> To extend this algorithm for quadratic
    compression we do no more than modify XSTEP with each data point. <br>
    The modification is to subtract a small amount A from XSTEP either
    each cycle of X or for faster operation at slightly less smooth
    compression we can do it only after outputting each Y datum. <br>
    Changing XSTEP is in effect altering the compression ratio with each
    step. <br>
    <br>
    To calculate what A should be we need the following input: <br>
    DX: number of input points to compress, <br>
    DY: number of output points OR equivalently <br>
    NR: net compression desired= DY/DX, a number &lt; one. <br>
    We also need: <br>
    IR: initial compression rate= starting value for XSTEP. The free
    choice of IR corresponds to choosing what part of the quadratic
    curve we are using to compress by. A common sense IR value is ONE
    saying that we want the low end data to be approximately 1:1 as
    there is no advantage to expanding data. As an aside: a slight
    modification of the loop, which can in fact be coded as a common
    loop, provides expansion rather than compression. <br>
    An IR value less than one has the effect of losing resolution at the
    low end to gain resolution (lesser local compression) at the high
    end. <br>
    The NR actual may be slightly different then the NR desired due to
    round off of computer math. <br>
    NR can usually be allowed to wander enough so that the A parameter,
    whose LSB determines the precision of YFRAC, XSTEP, and itself, is
    in range of fixed point math. Without this pragmatism the algorithm
    is somewhat computationally intensive. <br>
    Due to the way X datums are split the precision of the product
    YFRAC*X value can be quite limited, the integral is preserved up to
    an uncertainty of a fraction of the integration boundary coordinate.
    <br>
    DY= sum of XSTEP for Y steps. <br>
    XSTEP(0)= IR. <br>
    XSTEP(1)=IR-A; <br>
    XSTEP(2)=XSTEP(1)-A=IR-A-A=IR-A*2; <br>
    XSTEP(i)=IR-A*i; <br>
    sum of XSTEP(i) for i=0 to DX-1= IR*DX - A*(DX/2)*(DX-1) using the
    formula for sum of i. <br>
    DY= DX*[IR-(A/2)*(DX-1)]; notice this is like y=ax+bxý <br>
    NR= IR-(A/2)*(DX-1) <br>
    FR=final rate=IR-A*DX is approx. 2*NR which corresponds to the
    differential formula: dy/dx=d/dx(x<sup>2</sup>)=2*x. <br>
    A slight alteration of the order of operations in the processing
    loop changes the summation range to from 1 to DX which changes the
    formula for NR to: NR= IR-(A/2)*(DX+1), with DX &gt;&gt;1 we don't
    have to be picky about what we are doing. <br>
    So: A= 2*(IR-NR)/(DX-1). (or DX+1 if you prefer). <br>
    Note that IR must be greater than NR. If XSTEP goes below zero due
    to round off (or iterating cycle too many steps) the algorithm
    fails. <br>
    XSTEP exactly zero corresponds to an infinite compression ratio of
    1/0, below zero this is the other branch of the 1/x hyperbola and as
    such yields expansion rather than compression. <br>
    Using DY instead of NR as a given, and choosing IR= ONE: A=
    2*(1-DY/DX)/(DX-1) is approx. 2*(DX-DY)/DXý. <br>
    This last expression may be interpreted as "the A parameter is like
    twice the number of points to be discarded divided by the square of
    the number to keep". <br>
    For my favorite case of 4096 points compressing to 1024 (2 to 12th
    squeezed into 2 to 10th): <br>
    A=2*(1- (1024/4096))/(4095)= (3/2)/4095. <br>
    Multiplying by 4095/4096 creates a error 1/4095 every 4096th cycle
    of operation. This means no error until the last cycle whose result
    is trashed anyway. <br>
    This makes A=3*2<sup>-13</sup> which is 1.1*2<sup>-12</sup> in base
    2 which is .0000 0000 0001 1... which fits nicely into a 16 bit
    integer. <br>
    The infinitely precise number would be .0000 0000 0001 1000 0000
    0001 1000 0000 0001 etc. repeating in cycles of 12 bits. <br>
    Other power of two ratios also nicely reduce to simple bit patterns,
    and similarly so for IRs that are a (negative) power of two. <br>
    In general one may truncate the A value to double the order of
    magnitude of the number of given points, e.g. 24 bit math for up to
    4096 input points. If you record the actual net compression and use
    it for calculating offsets for integration then the error in A will
    be significantly compensated for.
    <hr>Higher order compressions, e.g. cubic, are implemented by
    modifying the A parameter each step. Any finite polynomial
    compression of order N can be reduced to N+1 adds, in effect
    integrating a constant N times to get a*x<sup>N</sup>. <br>
    One gets polynomial equations for the A terms which are in the limit
    of large numbers the Taylor series coefficients. I have never found
    a use for any such compression.
    <hr>The compression may be expressed in words: <br>
    accumulate X points until they equal a Y point. <br>
    Expansion is the complementary operation and can be expressed: <br>
    output fractions of the input point until it is exhausted. The
    fraction increases linearly with each output to make it quadratic. <br>
    For each X datum: <br>
    Do <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output XSTEP* X datum <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YFRAC +=XSTEP XSTEP -= A <br>
    until YFRAC&gt;=1 <br>
    YFRAC-=1 (retain just the fractional part) <br>
    pick up a new X datum. <br>
    <br>
    The above skips the fine detail of splitting X data via YFRAC at the
    boundaries. <br>
    DY= sum 1 to DY of XSTEP(i); <br>
    XSTEP(0)=IR <br>
    XSTEP(i)=XSTEP(i-1)-A; <br>
    XSTEP(i)=IR-A*i <br>
    DY= IR*DY-A*(DY/2)*(DY+1) <br>
    DY= DY*[IR-(A/2)*(DY+1)] <br>
    1 = IR-(A/2)*(DY+1) <br>
    A = 2*(1-IR)/(DY+1). <br>
    But this time around we can't choose IR to be one! So we have to add
    some other condition<br>

    <h3>If division is expensive but you have a cheap integer multiply
      (such as in an FPGA with single step multipliers, or a Cortex-M
      processor with DSP unit)</h3>
    This is also pertinent when the ratio of the two values (3 and 10)
    in the example gets truncated enough when converted to some integral
    form that there is cumulative error in the effective compression
    amount. This variation will not accumulate any error, it works using
    rational numers rather than real. Even with hardware floating point
    that would make the original implementation reasonable, that would
    have roundoff since floating point only approximates a real number.<br>

    For every step we add 3*x to the accumulator.<br>
    If the tracker is positive we added too much, we subtract out
    tracker*x from the accumulator then output the accumulator. We
    convey that '3' to whatever receives the accumulator value, using a
    'rational number' data type.<br>
    We then subtract out 10 from the tracker and proceed.<br>
    In my use cases the accumulated data is plotted, and as such we just
    adjust the plotting scale rather than the numbers themselves. Any
