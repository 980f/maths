    <br>
    Derivation of best for hardwiring square root algorithm:<br>
    <br>
    This is the algebraic derivation of an algorithm for extracting the
    square root of a fixed point binary number. It is also quite handy
    for
    taking the root of the mantissa of a floating point number. It is
    very
    similar to, and just a little bit more complex than the
    NON-RESTORING
    binary division algorithm.<br>
    <br>
    TERMINOLOGY: The number to be rooted will be referred to as the
    Square.
    The answer is the Root. If the square is not a perfect square then
    there is a Remainder: <br>
    <br>
    Square= Root²+Remainder, and Remainder &gt;=0.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    INPUT CONSTRAINTS: <br>
    The Square is positive. <br>
    For each two bits of the
    Square one bit of Root is created, which forces one to provide an
    even
    number of bits to the integer side of the radix point. <br>
    One may prefix a
    zero to the string to line up the radix point. <br>
    Also since the bits of
    the square are processed in pairs the number of bits trailing the
    radix
    point must be even. One may add a trailing zero as necessary to make
    this true. <br>
    (FYI: log(X²)=2*log(X) and number of bits = log(X)
    hence the Square has twice as many bits as the Root).<br>
    <br>
    OVERFLOW CONDITIONS: <br>
    The Root is generated as an unsigned number of half of the bits of
    the
    Square. If the Root is desired to fit into a 2's complement format
    one
    must treat the Square also as signed which means that the two MSB's
    of
    the square must be zero else one overflows the Root.<br>
    <br>
    The final Remainder may be as large as 2*Root, this is gotten from
    Max
    Remainder=(Root+1)² -Root²-1
    =(Root²+2*Root+1)-Root²-1= 2*Root. This is one bit more than
    the Root itself.<br>
    <br>
    During the cycling of the algorithm there is a provisional Remainder
    which is signed and hence takes a bit for that in addition to
    needing
    one more than the root. This means that the width of the ALU
    (arithmetic logic unit) used in the algorithm can constrain the
    range
    of the Root and Remainder.<br>
    <br>
    TRICKS USED/USEFUL ALGEBRA:<br>
    <br>
    -X = ~X+1 or ~X= -X-1<br>
    <br>
    where ~X is the one's complement also known as the boolean inverse.
    In
    words this says that the negative of a number may be gotten by
    replacing all the ones with zeroes and vice versa (the inverse) then
    adding one.<br>
    <br>
    * means multiply:<br>
    4*X= X shifted left two places.<br>
    2*X= X shifted left one place.<br>
    (2*X +1)²= (2*X)² +2*(2*X) +1²=4*X² +4*X +1<br>
    0²=0 and 1²=1 so bit²=bit<br>
    <br>
    MOST CONFUSING PART OF ALGORITHM: <br>
    This is an iterative algorithm. It
    generates the answer from MSB to LSB, one bit per cycle. <br>
    To eliminate
    tracking powers of two throughout the derivation I scale the numbers
    so that the bit about to be generated is the LSB of the Root at this
    stage. Each cycle rescales the Square and the Root to keep this
    true.<br>
    <br>
    Let Root(n) mean Root at cycle n. I manipulate the data being
    processed
    so that Root(n+1)=2*Root(n)+new LSB. In hardware this is simply
    shifting new bits into the LSB of the result register. <br>
    Since the bits
    for cycles N+2 and beyond are not yet relevant I treat Root(n) as an
    integer.&nbsp; <br>
    Likewise I need only consider those bits of Square which
    can be affected by the new LSB of Root. <br>
    Hence I define Square(n) to be
    those bits of Square which are relevant at this cycle, scaled by
    some
    power of two that correlates to the scaling of Root(n).<br>
    <br>
    If I increase the scale of the Root by 2 then I must increase the
    scale
    of the Square by 2² which is 4. This is the same in binary as
    shifting left two places, expressed arithmetically as:<br>
    <br>
    Root(n+1)= 2*Root(n)+bit where bit is short for 'new LSB'.<br>
    Square(n+1)= 4*Square(n)+sqbits(n+1).<br>
    where sqbits are the two new bits relevant for cycle n+1. sqbits
    ranges from 0 to 3.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    Notice we have gotten rid of the squaring operation by taking
    advantage
    of the previous cycle's results! <br>
    If we interpret Root(0) as the Root
    with no bits then Square(0) also has no bits hence Rem(0)=0. <br>
    With this
    in hand we see that we never need to square anything during
    the&nbsp;
    algorithm. That's nice.<br>
    <br>
    Now we must ask: what is the correct value of bit? <br>
    Being an ignorant
    slob I shall try puttin' a one into the equation and then see if the
    Rem() that results is negative or not. <br>
    If it is negative then since
    Rem() is supposed to be &gt;=0 we are in error and bit is actually
    0. <br>
    <br>
    Time for more algebra:<br>
    <br>
    Test(n) is Rem(n) with bit presumed to be 1<br>
    <br>
    Test(n+1)= 4*(Rem(n) -Root(n)) +(sqbits -1)<br>
    <br>
    If Test(n+1) is &gt;=0 then<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Root(n+1)=2*Root(n)+1<br>
      Rem(n+1)=Test(n+1).<br>
    </div>
    else<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Root(n+1)=2*Root(n)+0<br>
      Rem(n+1)= 4*Rem(n).<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    We could stop here and write a pretty simple algorithm.<br>
    It would go like:<br>
    (Initialize)<br>
    For the number of bits in root:<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">test=rem-answer<br>
      shift test up two places sucking in bits from<br>
      the square<br>
      test=test-1<br>
      answer=answer shifted up one place with the COMPLEMENT of the sign
      bit
      shifted in the LS end.<br>
      if test&lt;0 then<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">rem= rem shifted up two places,
        bringing in bits from square<br>
      </div>
      else <br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">rem= test.<br>
      </div>
    </div>
    loop for next bits<br>
    (Finish up)<br>
    <br>
    Well that seems pretty good until you get to the "rem=rem
    shifted...".
    That would require that we store this last rem value (perhaps
    already
    shifted) somewhere and take the time to check and if necessary use
    it
    instead of the otherwise useful "test". <br>

    This by itself is a minor improvement. Instead of recovering a saved
    rem and having to shift it etc. we could add in twice the newly

    Not much difference now. If we let the previous cycle's result bit
    control this cycle's operation between Test() and Root() then we
    don't
    have to keep around a spare copy of something like Rem and we don't
    have to take time to add 2*something+1, we can defer that to the
    next
    cycle. Onward to the finale.<br>

    The difference is reduced to conditionally complementing the Root
    from
    the previous cycle. <br>
    All operations are addition which may simplify
    direct hardware implementation. <br>
    A useful fact is that if bit(n)=0 then
    the lsb of the +Root(n) term is zero, if bit(n)=1 then the lsb of
    the&nbsp; +~Root(n) is zero; <br>
    i.e. what ever the case the lsb of the
    root or its complement is always zero which is a dandy place to
    shove
    the carry bit of the sqbits+3 operation.<br>
    <br>
    For implementing on a typical microprocessor the order of
    calculations
    in the loop might be:<br>
    <br>
    add 110000..... to the register holding Square.<br>
    if lsb of root is 1 then <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">subtract root from test with borrow<br>
    </div>
    else <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">add root to test with carry<br>
    </div>
    shift up square, msb goes to carry bit<br>
    shift up test with carry in<br>
    if test msb is not the same as the carry then we had a remainder
    overflow. (note 1)<br>
    shift up root with carry in<br>
    shift up square, msb goes to carry bit<br>
    shift up test with carry in<br>
    if test msb is not the same as the carry then we had a remainder
    overflow. (note 2)<br>
    <br>
    note 1: this overflow can only occur on the last cycle.<br>
    note 2: this overflow can only occur in the last two cycles.<br>
    These two notes might be useful if "unrolling the loop" is used for
    faster execution.<br>
    <br>
    REMAINING INFO: <br>
    If we desire to have the remainder reported then we
    must consider that on the final cycle we might have generated a bit
    of
    0. <br>
    In this case the Test value we maintain in the loop in lieu of the
    explicit remainder is due for a correction. <br>
    During the loop we deferred
    this calculation but now we must add Test(last)+2*Root(last)+1=
    Rem(last). <br>
    If Test had not yet overflowed the number of bits this last
    calculation might do it.<br>

    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">FLOATING POINT NUMBERS: <br>
    <br>
    Floating point numbers in typical computers
    consist of two fixed point binary numbers. One is the exponent, the
    other the mantissa. Usually the mantissa is defined to be between 1
    and
    2. <br>
    The number's value is:<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">value= mantissa*2^(exponent-bias),
      where ^ means 'to the power of' and
      bias is some fixed number such as 128. I'll ignore the bias from
      now on
      to simplify the algebra.<br>
    </div>
    &nbsp;<br>
    &#8730; is the square root symbol.<br>
    <br>
    &#8730;value=&#8730;(mantissa*2^exponent) =&#8730;mantissa*&#8730;(2^exponent)
    =&#8730;mantissa*2^(exponent/2)<br>
    <br>
    If exponent is even then our result is gotten by taking the root of
    the
    mantissa, which will be between 1 and &#8730;2, ready for packing back
    into
    floating point format. Exponent/2 is exponent shifted down once. <br>
    <br>
    If the exponent is odd then to make life simple we do the following
    algebra:<br>
    <br>
    &#8730;value=&#8730;(mantissa*2^exponent) =&#8730;(2*mantissa*2^exponent-1)
    =&#8730;(2*mantissa)*&#8730;(2^exponent-1) =&#8730;(2*mantissa)*2^(exponent-1)/2<br>
    <br>
    (exponent-1)/2 is an integer 'cause exponent is odd.<br>
    &#8730;(2*mantissa) is between &#8730;(2*1) and &#8730;(2*2)
    and hence
    is between &#8730;2 and 2 and therefore we can pack our&nbsp; floating
    point
    number with no worry about further exponent adjustments.<br>
    <br>
    What this comes out to be is:<br>
    <br>
    If exponent is odd then shift the mantissa up once before rooting
    with
    the fixed point algorithm to get the final mantissa.<br>
    Shift the exponent down once to get the final exponent, ignoring the
    bit
    shifted out.<br>

    No one helped me with this! I read some stuff on "non-restoring"
    division but it was so poorly written that I all I got out of it was
    that it could be done. <br>
    Having mastered division the generation of the square root algorithm
    was a matter of deciding that it must exist and then doing the math.
    <br>
    <br>
    A HUMOROUS NOTE: When I first coded up a less elegant version of
    this
    to run on a micro I gave it the number 25 to take the root of. The
    answer came back 6 remainder 1. This was a root one too high and a
    remainder one too high and that was the&nbsp; kind of thing that
    plagued me while microcoding the division algorithm. After about 30
    minutes of seeking the error I thought to square the 6 and add the
    one.
    I got 37 and it finally dawned on me that I had entered a hex 25,
    not a
    decimal number. Hex 25 = decimal 37 which has a root of 6 and a
    remainder of 1.<br>
