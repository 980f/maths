    <h2>Extracting peak amplitude and width from a stream of pulses</h2>
    <h3>using a polyomial fit to a quadratic </h3>
    <hr>Given a stream of digitized values of an analog signal the task is to produce a stream of peak values, and a secondary task of their width.<br>
    <br>
    The width is estimated from the 2nd derivative being zero on the rise to the same on the fall.<br>
    The amplitude is the value of the quadratic polynomial where the first derivative is zero.<br>
    <br>
    Let C<sub>0</sub> C<sub>1 </sub>C<sub>2</sub> be the coefficients of the quadratic.<br>
    The location of the peak is determined by C1==0. Since we are sampling a stream we are unlikely to ever see an exact value of 0 so what we record is the location where the sign went from positive to negative, and with that the values before and after so that we might interpolate, before/(before-after) is where in the prior sample the zero was. If it happens that we compute before-after as part of computing the new value we can save off {location, after, after-before} and compute inferred coordinate as location-(after/(after-before)).<br>
    <br>
    The width coordinates are treated the same way, we record location and the discriminant and its delta from the cell where we see a change in sign of the discriminant.<br>

    We detect inflection points by C<sub>2</sub> sign change, peak by C<sub>1</sub> sign change.<br>
    The signs are unaffected by the denominators so we can defer applying those to the users of the actual values. Since they are constants they will often either fold into a denominator or be ratioed into irrelevancy.<br>
    For detecting the peak we just have to compute the Y<sub>1 </sub>which entails an add of a temp from Y<sub>0</sub> computation, an add-multiply, and then an add with detection of sign change.Note: detecting a perfect zero adds a tiny bit to precision.<br>
    For detecting inflection points we have to test a linear combination of Y0 and Y2: S<sub>0</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>-S<sub>2</sub>Y0. S2 has a factor of S<sub>0</sub> in it so our discriminant is Y<sub>2</sub>-S<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>0 </sub>. Computing that takes quite a bit more than for the Y<sub>1</sub> in that we have to compute Y<sub>0</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub> and then a multiply-add on top of that. <br>
    Two of the components for Y2 are temporary values in the computation of Y0 and Y1 so we don't count them again here. <br>
    <br>
    To get the interpolated value at the peak we use the slope's delta and value to get the value that we then put into C<sub>0</sub>+C<sub>1</sub>x+C<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup>. We don't have to save off the 3 C<sub>i</sub> values, the slope value gets us C<sub>1</sub>, the inflection test value gets us C<sub>2</sub> and we only need to add Y<sub>0</sub>, the moving average, to our record to get what we need to compute the quadratic.<br>
    That is 4 integers total for the peak's attributes, plus perhaps 1..3 locations for width and symmetry detection.The number of bits for location is up to the data stream, zeroing it for the leading inflection point limits the need to the maximum width of a peak. <br>
    The moving average is of 2<em>h</em>+1 points, each of ADC bits amplitude. For up to 31 points (<em>h</em>=15) that is an additional 5 bits, 16 bits total for an 11 bit ADC. <br>
    The slope value is always small near where it crosses zero, and the sign bit is known from the algorithm, for physical signals of interest this will be fewer bits than the ADC.<br>
    The curvature value is also small near its zero crossings, but is on the order of <em>h</em><sup>2</sup>+<em>h</em> times moving average. For our example of 31 points that comes to about 8 bits, although that is the size of each of the terms whose difference is what is the curvature, so this is likely to be a gross overestimate.<br>

    Note: y[...] is a circular buffer of 2h+1+1 words, with the second +1 so that we don't need tight coordination between reading and writing. Rounding that up to a power of 2 is likely to be worth the extra ram used. If ram is very tight we can use a 2h+1 sized buffer, at a slight increase in the number of registers or inline constant loads needed.<br>

    ~36 clocks on&nbsp; cortexM, 8 of which are intermittent and with adequate buffering (ring buffer more than 2h+2 words) can reduced the total to around 28. Some devices have a DMA controller than might be able to do the 8 clocks worth of data moving in parallel with minimal computation.<br>
    <br>
    If the change record is maintained in adjacent registers then a "store multiple" instruction can write them out. This is relevant when the range of conditional jumps is small, such as the 3 instruction limit of the IT instruction in cortexM parts. Such an operation typically still takes a clock or more per value, but some systems will have a DMA controller than can do such a move as well as maintain the addressing it needs.<br>
